# Product Framing (Alpha.CA.gov)
(example)

## Problem statement
The people of California need information and services offered by the State of California. Currently, California state government digital information and services are disparate, spread across multiple domains and websites. Each state organization manages its content and experience differently, causing a lack of cohesiveness, findability, accessibility, security, and performance across all California government websites. This lack of organization leads to a lack of trust and low satisfaction from the people we intend to serve.

## Product vision
CA.gov will show the people of California that their government is unwaveringly committed to meeting the needs of the people of California. The experience will be simpler, clearer, faster, and more accessible for all Californians searching for state government information and services. They will recognize CA.gov as the official California state government website. It will give them the comprehensive state government information and services that they seek. The public will be able to find their services without knowing the names or acronyms of the related State organizations.

## What we want to learn
How can user research and content design help meet user needs
What it takes for government to work in the open
How to best set up a highly effective digital services team 

## What we're not trying to do 
Redesign all of the State of California’s digital government services
Set the State of California’s technology strategy
Maintain traditional practices in digital and technology strategy and execution 

## Product assumptions and dependencies
That people go first to their government official website to find what they’re looking for. 
That we understand what matters most to people
That the way users currently find government services online is their preferred method
That users don’t care about an agency-focused approach
