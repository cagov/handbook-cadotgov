**Slack** 

Slack is a required chat tool for the Alpha team. We’ll use it to communicate with each other in a central place. 

**Expectations**

* Use your Alpha email (do not use your personal email). You will receive an invite in your Alpha inbox.

* Complete your profile. Help the team get to know you by sharing basic details about yourself. Include your first and last name, followed by your location and personal pronouns in parenthesis, if you’d like. Then add a profile picture, phone number, and a summary of what you do.

* Enable multi-factor authentication (2FA). You can either set up 2FA through text message (SMS) or an authentication tool such as OKTA.
 
* Expect everything you share will be made public. Every word you write, photo you upload, and link you share is entered into a public forum.

**Policy Compliance**

Users must comply with GovOps Policies

**Setup**

Log into Slack online or download it to your desktop from the following places. 
* For Mac users: https://slack.com/downloads/mac

**Creating new channels**

* Only the administrator can add new channels.
* The administrator will process and reply to all requests for new channels on the #Admin channel.
* How to submit a request:
