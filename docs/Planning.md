## Purpose:
The primary focus will be to plan the upcoming sprint. Capacity will be documented for each team member contributing to the sprint.

## Guidelines
1. We will have at least one weekly sprint planning session
1. Zoom will be used for remote staff to participate
1. Team members are encouraged volunteer to create stories/issues throughout the week to discuss in the next sprint planning session
1. Use the fibonacci scale. Estimate in 1,2,3,5,8,13 increments
1. If a story is an 8 or above, break it down to smaller stories with less complexity.
1. Once the sprint backlog satisfies the velocity, the planning session is complete.
