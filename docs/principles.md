# Principles

## Design principles

Design principles help teams and stakeholders to align on design vision and decision-making.

They give us a shared understanding to help us prioritize our next steps.

In the spirit of moving quickly, we’re leveraging the proven work of teams like 18F and the UK Government Digital Services. And as our starting point, we’re adopting and iterating on the [design principles created by GDS](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/government-design-principles#start-with-user-needs).

The Alpha.CA.gov design principles include:

* Start with user needs
* Do less
* Design with data, research, intuition, and experimentation
* Do the hard work to make it simple and elegant
* Iterate. Then iterate again.
* Make it accessible and inclusive
* Understand context
* Build digital services, not websites
* Be consistent but not uniform
* Make things open: it makes things better
* Prioritize security, respect privacy
* Optimize performance

These principles will inform our product design. And we’ll continue to iterate and refine them as we learn by doing.
