# Principles

## Operational principles

* Default to open
* Understand what people need
* Use data to drive decisions
* Address the whole experience, from start to finish
* Make it simple and intuitive
* Build the service using agile and iterative practices
* Assign one leader and hold that person accountable
* Bring in experienced teams
* Emphasize collaboration across teams
* Structure budgets and contracts to support delivery
* Choose a modern technology stack
* Deploy in a flexible hosting environment
* Automate testing and deployments
* Manage security and privacy through reusable processes

## Design principles

Design principles help teams and stakeholders to align on design vision and decision-making.

They give us a shared understanding to help us prioritize our next steps.

In the spirit of moving quickly, we’re leveraging the proven work of teams like 18F and the UK Government Digital Services. And as our starting point, we’re adopting and iterating on the [design principles created by GDS](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/government-design-principles#start-with-user-needs).

The Alpha.CA.gov design principles include:

* Start with user needs
* Do less
* Design with data, research, intuition, and experimentation
* Do the hard work to make it simple and elegant
* Iterate. Then iterate again.
* Make it accessible and inclusive
* Understand context
* Build digital services, not websites
* Be consistent but not uniform
* Make things open: it makes things better
* Prioritize security, respect privacy
* Optimize performance

These principles will inform our product design. And we’ll continue to iterate and refine them as we learn by doing.

## Product framing

(example from [Alpha.CA.gov](https://alpha.ca.gov))

### Problem statement

The people of California need information and services offered by the State of California. Currently, California state government digital information and services are disparate, spread across multiple domains and websites. Each state organization manages its content and experience differently, causing a lack of cohesiveness, findability, accessibility, security, and performance across all California government websites. This lack of organization leads to a lack of trust and low satisfaction from the people we intend to serve.

### Product vision

CA.gov will show the people of California that their government is unwaveringly committed to meeting the needs of the people of California. The experience will be simpler, clearer, faster, and more accessible for all Californians searching for state government information and services. They will recognize CA.gov as the official California state government website. It will give them the comprehensive state government information and services that they seek. The public will be able to find their services without knowing the names or acronyms of the related State organizations.

### What we want to learn

* How can user research and content design help meet user needs
* What it takes for government to work in the open
* How to best set up a highly effective digital services team 

### What we're not trying to do 

* Redesign all of the State of California’s digital government services
* Set the State of California’s technology strategy
* Maintain traditional practices in digital and technology strategy and execution 

### Product assumptions and dependencies

* That people go first to their government official website to find what they’re looking for. 
* That we understand what matters most to people
* That the way users currently find government services online is their preferred method
* That users don’t care about an agency-focused approach 
* Prioritization criteria for user needs
* The Alpha will be based on initial user needs that are selected with data, intuition, and experimentation. The following criteria will be used to assess the overall impact of the user story. 

### Criteria
* Total reach (population)	
* Biggest area for improvement	
* Level of complexity	
* Level of Urgency
* Who (individuals or business)	
* Vulnerable population	
* Topical for Californians	
* Sensitive	
* Positive, Wow-factor, innovative	
* Common or specific need	
* Ability to capture data analytics
* Public facing issue

#### Internal

* Existing effort already in place	
* Stakeholder priority	
* Measurable impact	
* Open /Helpful departments
* Discrete part of information or service
* Long term, push to Beta
